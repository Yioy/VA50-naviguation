[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/arusso/dev/VA50-naviguation/src/transformtrack/CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenBLAS.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OpenBLAS",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenBLAS" with any
  of the following names:

    OpenBLASConfig.cmake
    openblas-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenBLAS" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenBLAS_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenBLAS" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
